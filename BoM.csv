ALL PRICES IN PLN!!!,,,,
Note:,,,,
Getting 10 switches is most of the time cheaper than getting 6.,,,,
I dont think its possible to find exactly or less than 4 screws or 6 keycaps on aliexpress (And they're cheap anyway).,,,,
And once again i couldnt find screws or inserts in a good price that didnt come in big packs.,,,,
